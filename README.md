# Challenge09

## Description
This project leverages the OpenWeather API to streamline server-side data retrieval, delivering weather information seamlessly to the client side for display on a deployed website hosted on Render. The application features a visually appealing and user-friendly design, enabling users to easily access detailed weather information for any city, including a 5-day forecast. Additionally, the app stores users' search history, allowing for quick access to previously searched cities or the option to delete entries as desired.

## Usage

This is a functional weather dashboard with an intuitive form input system that allows users to search for cities and manage their search history through delete buttons. When a user enters a city name and clicks "Search," the interface updates to display both current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for the selected city. The city is then added to the search history for quick access.

Each cityâ€™s weather data is presented in a well-structured card layout, where the current weather appears in the largest card, and the 5-day forecast is displayed in smaller cards arranged in a row for easy navigation. Each card includes the city name, the date, an icon representing the weather conditions, a description of the weather (shown in the icon's alt tag), the temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Users can easily switch between cities by searching for a new location, with the ability to delete previously searched cities as needed. The weather dashboard features a user-friendly layout, displaying accurate, up-to-date information that is easy to understand and navigate. Powered by an API, the dashboard is reusable and can be used to check the weather for any city globally.
